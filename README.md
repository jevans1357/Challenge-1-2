# Code Refactor Starter Code
Steps to clean up from cloned version - 

1. Changed title from "website" to company name.
2. Updated missing id to fix link issue in header.
3. Added explicative notes in html and css files to break out sections for clarity.
4. Consolidated the css code by replacing unique class names for each section with names that applied more broadly allowing to reduce duplicative css code.
